## Air - A minimalist WordPress starter theme

Air is designed to be a minimal starting point for a WordPress project at [Digitoimisto Dude Oy](https://www.dude.fi), a Finnish boutique digital agency in the center of Jyväskylä. Theme is based on [_s]("https://github.com/automattic/_s").

This theme is built to be very straightforward, front end developer friendly and only partly modular by its structure.

### Please note before using

Air is a **development theme**, so it has updates very often. By using this starter theme, you agree that the anything can change to a different direction without a warning.

Air is not meant to be "a theme for everyone", so it doesn't have many parts that are generally included (see [Disabled features](#disabled-features)).

If you for some reason happen to use this theme as base, please note the theme won't necessarily be that much fun or won't necessarily look any good. I recommend using [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) if you need something more complete.

### License

Dudestarter is licensed with [The MIT License (MIT)](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) which means you can freely use this theme commercially or privately, modify it, or distribute it, but you are forbidden to hold Dude liable for anything, or claim that what you do with this is made by us.

### Features

#### Layout base & grid

* All good things from the latest [Underscores](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)-support (SCSS-syntax)
* CSS reset with a combination with Nicolas Gallagher's [normalize*css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
* [Jeet](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet) Grid for SASS `@include col(1/100)`
* Container div inside site-main
* Possible to choose between fluid (flexible 100%) and snappy grid style (snapping to breakpoint, more space around)
* Inline SVG-ready

#### Typography

* Responsive typography with viewport units with fallbacks (formerly [Megatype](https://github.com/StudioThick/megatype), still recommended with blogs or text-only based sites, but not included by default after 1.5.0)
* Google Webfonts with Penman's [Sass-Web-Fonts](https://github.com/penman/Sass-Web-Fonts)
* Web fonts helper: [Sass Boilerplate's fontFace-mixin](https://github.com/magnetikonline/sassboilerplate/blob/master/fontface.scss) (if you have .odt, .ttf, .woff, .woff2 in `fonts` directory, you can add them with `@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', '../fonts/proximanova-regular-webfont', 400);`)

#### Development

* [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for keeping multiple browsers and devices synchronized while testing, along with injecting updated CSS and JS into your browser while you're developing (included in [devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages))
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build script that compiles both Less and Sass, checks for JavaScript errors, optimizes images, and concatenates and minifies files (see Dude's [devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages))
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) for front-end package management

#### Navigation

* Custom navigation walker based on Bootstrap 3

* Jetpack support
* Customizer
* RTL support
* Threaded comments
* Template tags (direct edit preferred)

### Recommendations for development

* Mac OS X
* [Devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages) - Npm, Gulp and Bower
* [Dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) - A toolkit for creating a new professional WordPress project with deployments. Heavily based on Bedrock by Roots.

### Installation

Traditional way:

1. Git clone or download zip
2. Open Terminal and run `npm install`
3. Open project to Atom (or your preferred editor) and run search and replace air => yourprojectname
4. Run `gulp watch` and start coding

If you are using [Dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) and [Devpackages](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/devpackages), your project folder is located at `~/Projects`, your vagrant box is up and running at `10.1.2.4`, just

1. Open Terminal and cd to air directory
2. Run `sh newtheme.sh` - the script takes care of the rest (updates textdomain with your project name, checks updates for air and npm packages, runs npm install, fetches devpackages, sets up gulp, cleans up the leftover files and activates the theme via wp-cli)

### Contributing

If you have ideas about the theme or spot an issue, please let us know. Before contributing ideas or reporting an issue about "missing" features or things regarding to the nature of that matter, please read [Please note](#please-note-before-using) section. Thank you very much.

### Notes

Gzip file sizes tested with `wc -c css/global.css` and `gzip -c css/global.css | wc -c` commands.
